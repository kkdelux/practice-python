After watching the videos and getting an overall idea on hash tables, I realized
that there was a variety of ways to tackle the problem of hashing and dealing with
collisions. However, I will only implement Hashing with chaining for now. This is
because, collision problems that get resolved linear/random probing just seem
ugly and inefficient. On the other side of things, solving collision problems with
Universal Hashing and Perfect Hashing, are mathematically and algorithmically
a bit over my head (Though I will revisit each once I feel I have the knowledge
capable to handle them intuitively).
